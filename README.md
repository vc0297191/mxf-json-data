## Contributing to the project
1. Clone the [mxf-json-data repository](https://github.com/mysterypaintwo/mxf-json-data). I highly recommend using [Github Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/download/) if you've never used git before.
2a. Download the [RandoJsonDataEditor](https://github.com/mysterypaintwo/RandoJsonDataEditor/releases/new). Run the editor and click "Set Working Directory" at the top-left.
2b. Alternatively, refer to the [Schema Documentation](https://github.com/vg-json-data/mxf-json-data/tree/main/documentation) for formatting expectations when contributing.
3. When your edits are done, [create a pull request](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request) for your changes back to the main repository.
